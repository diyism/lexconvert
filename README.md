# lexconvert
Convert phoneme codes and lexicon formats for English speech synths, from http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/gradint/lexconvert.html
(also mirrored at http://ssb22.gitlab.io/gradint/lexconvert.html as the Cambridge "DS-Web" server sometimes gets taken down for several days of maintenance)
